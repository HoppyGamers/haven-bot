---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Web Dashboard (Phase 5)** — browser-based admin panel on port 3003
  - Token-based authentication via `/dashboard token` slash command
  - Overview page — bot status, uptime, channel list, live service health
  - Users page — XP leaderboard, total users, total XP, achievement count
  - Calendar page — upcoming events with notification status and RSVP counts
  - RSS Feeds page — all feeds with item counts and last item title
  - Moderation Log page — recent actions with unban button
  - AI Agent Stats page — conversation counts, memory, tool usage chart, recent tool log
  - Settings page — runtime config (bot name, timezone, delete timers, RSS intervals) applied without restart
  - Write actions: create/edit/delete calendar events, add/remove/pause RSS feeds, add/remove channels, unban users
- **Runtime channel management** — add/remove channels without restart
  - `/addchannel <name> <code> <token>` — add a channel at runtime
  - `/removechannel <code>` — remove a DB-managed channel
  - `/channels` — list all configured channels with source indicator
  - Channels persist across restarts in `bot_channels` table
- **Fast startup** — slash command registration skipped on restart if commands unchanged
  - MD5 hash of command list + channels stored in `bot_settings` table
  - Subsequent restarts boot in seconds instead of 2+ minutes
  - Hash invalidates automatically when commands or channels change

### Fixed
- RSS duplicate posting — `item_title` column migration was missing, causing `markSeen` to fail silently
- `/rss check` now posts items to each feed's configured channel instead of the command channel
- Passive/mention mode no longer responds to slash commands (prevented duplicate responses)
- Calendar notifications now store `notify_at` in SQLite datetime format (was ISO format, broke comparisons)
- File upload paths no longer trigger unknown command errors
- Dashboard health page `process.env` reference removed from browser JS
- Duplicate API routes in dashboard server removed

### Changed
- `.env.example` rewritten — cleaner sections, bootstrap vs runtime channel explanation, all new vars documented
- `/calendar` help expanded with date format examples and notify offset explanation
- `/rss list` now shows which channel each feed posts to
- Auto-delete timers split into three categories: `HELP_DELETE_SECONDS`, `ADMIN_DELETE_SECONDS`, `USER_DELETE_SECONDS`

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **RSS Digest (Phase 4A)** — scheduled AI summaries of RSS feed content
  - `/bob rss_digest add <threshold> <source_code> <dest_code> <daily|weekly> [day] <time>`
  - Collects real article titles from `rss_seen`, summarizes via Ollama
  - Prevents hallucination — prompt explicitly instructs use of real titles only
  - `/bob rss_digest list`, `run`, `remove` commands
  - Scheduler runs every 30 minutes
- **AI Event Briefing (Phase 4B)** — AI-enhanced calendar reminders
  - Fires alongside every calendar notification when agent is enabled
  - Searches SearXNG for current context about the event title
  - Adapts to any event type — races, game releases, movies, etc.
  - Non-blocking — plain reminder fires regardless of briefing success
- **Tool call logging** — all agent tool calls logged to `tool_log` table in `haven-agent.db`
- **English language enforcement** — agent always responds in English regardless of message language
- **`/bob help`** — full AI Agent command reference, respects `HELP_DELETE_SECONDS`
- **AI Agent section in `/help`** — shown only when `AGENT_ENABLED=true`

### Fixed
- Skipped RSS items no longer reappear — flood-limited items marked seen immediately
- Agent participation modes (mention/passive/active) now work correctly
- Passive mode responds to replies when Bob's last message was a question
- `/bob config disable` — agent can now be re-enabled after disabling (config commands bypass enabled check)
- Mention mode uses full agent name match to prevent false positives

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **AI Agent** — optional AI assistant powered by Ollama, loaded only when `AGENT_ENABLED=true`
  - Configurable slash command trigger (`AGENT_COMMAND` env var, default `/bob`)
  - Configurable agent name and persona (`AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`)
  - Separate `haven-agent.db` database — fully isolated from `haven-bot.db`
- **Web search** — SearXNG integration for real-time answers (`SEARXNG_URL`)
  - Auto-detects queries that need current information
  - Injects search results as grounding context into Ollama prompt
  - Skips search for queries handled by tools (leaderboard, calendar, etc.)
- **Persistent memory** — agent remembers facts across conversations and restarts
  - Per-user and per-channel memory scopes
  - `remember <fact>` — store a fact
  - `what do you know about me?` — recall stored facts
  - `forget everything about me` — clear memories
- **Conversation history** — rolling multi-turn context per channel
  - Configurable history size (`AGENT_HISTORY_SIZE`)

  - `create_calendar_event` — add events with automatic reminders
  - `get_leaderboard` — fetch XP standings
  - `play_sound` — play soundboard sounds
  - `list_rss_feeds` — list monitored feeds
  - `get_datetime` — current date and time
  - Uses Ollama's native tool calling API for reliable execution
- **Participation modes** — configurable per channel at runtime
  - `command` — slash command only (default, safest)
  - `mention` — responds when full agent name appears in a message
  - `passive` — monitors messages, responds to questions and replies to its own questions
  - `active` — participates freely with cooldown
- **Per-channel agent configuration** — full persona switching without restart
  - `/bob config set-prompt` — custom system prompt
  - `/bob config set-mode` — participation mode
  - `/bob config set-name` — rename agent for this channel
  - `/bob config clear-history` — wipe conversation history
  - `/bob config clear-memory` — wipe channel memory
  - `/bob config enable/disable` — toggle agent (config commands work even when disabled)
  - `/bob config reset` — revert to global defaults
  - `/bob config show` — view current channel config
- **`/bob help`** — full AI Agent command reference, respects `HELP_DELETE_SECONDS`
- **AI Agent section in `/help`** — shown only when `AGENT_ENABLED=true`, shows model name
